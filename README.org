* passage.el: age encryption support for the standard unix password manager

#+html:<p align="center"><img src="img/passage.png"/></p>

passage.el builds on top of [[https://github.com/anticomputer/age.el][age.el]] to provide Emacs support for [[https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage][passage]] which
is an Age encryption based port of [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]], the standard unix password manager.

* Usage

Put the ~passage.el~ project in your ~load-path~ and:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'passage)
#+end_src

You can now interact with your [[https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage][passage]] based local encryption store. Please
see the [[https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage/blob/main/README][passage README]] for instructions on how to migrate from the gpg based
pass utility to the age based passage utility.

passage.el assumes your passage store is located at =~/.passage/store= but you
may customize this through the =auth-source-passage-filename= variable.

* Tips and Tricks

** Using passage store secrets in your elisp code

passage.el includes an =auth-source= back-end for passage, which means you can
programmatically fetch passwords out of your passage store with
=auth-source-passage-get=, e.g.:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(auth-source-passage-get 'secret "store/secret")
#+end_src

** Pass to passage migration

#+begin_src bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash
set -eou pipefail
cd "${PASSWORD_STORE_DIR:-$HOME/.password-store}"
while read -r -d "" passfile; do
    name="${passfile#./}"; name="${name%.gpg}"
    [[ -f "${PASSAGE_DIR:-$HOME/.passage/store}/$name.age" ]] && continue
    pass "$name" | passage insert -m "$name" || { passage rm "$name"; break; }
done < <(find . -path '*/.git' -prune -o -iname '*.gpg' -print0)
#+end_src

** Pinentry support

For pinentry support I recommend you use [[https://github.com/str4d/rage/][rage]] as your age encryption utility.

** Other passage use cases

The passage author has a nice walkthrough of their personal, non-emacs based,
passage configuration and future plans for the project here:

* Known Issues

** OTP plugin support is untested

I have not tested passage with the OTP plugins. Ostensibly the regular pass
plugins should work relatively unchanged but this is conjecture at this point.
